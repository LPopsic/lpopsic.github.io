    <h1 style="text-align: center;">URGENT MESSAGE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE POPSICL CHANNEL</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">by khampa</h3>

    <h2>I (khampa) am no longer going to appear in PopsicL's videos.</h2>

    <h2>No, it's not because we got into a fight.</h2>
    <h2>No, it's not because of personal reasons.</h2>
    <h2>It's because I no longer find gaming interesting. And no, this isn't one of those rants where somebody craps on the current game industry, even though I could write crap about that too.</h2>
    <h2>I don't like gaming anymore, because I don't find any form of games to be fun at all, not even board games.</h2>
    <h2>Also whenever I think I started to like gaming again after I've found a very interesting and fun game, I just get bored of it after a few days again.</h2>
    <h2>I don't even know why this has happened only over the past year or so. I just feel like whenever I'm playing a game, I'm forcing myself to do so.</h2>

    <h2>But why am I only quitting now, when this has been happening for over a year?</h2>
    <h2>Because while playing with friends it was still kind of easy to hide that I would rather be doing anything else but gaming at that moment.</h2>
    <h2>However this has been becoming pretty much impossible. I get into any game with my friends, and I instantly start tabbing out to do random things.</h2>
    <h2>It might be because I have started associating gaming with just wasting your time pointlessly looking at your computer screen and constantly holding wasd on your keyboard.</h2>
    <h2>I have been finding more enjoyment creating games, more than playing them. But the thing is, whenever I create my own game that I think is really fun, I get bored of it really quickly too.</h2>

    <h2>Well why game then?</h2>
    <h2>Yeah, why? Why am I forcing myself to game when I don't want to? Well I'm not anymore, as of today.</h2>
    <h2>Will you still see me in PopsicL's videos?</h2>
    <h2>If it's related to gaming (which is mainly what his channel is about), then no.</h2>
    <h2>Anyways, thanks to PopsicL for letting me have one of the entries in his journal thing. I also like how this message is going to be in a section "random stuff", when this is completely game changing (pun intended) for his channel.</h2>
    <h2>And if you're interested in what I'm going to do in the future, you can visit my profile on Github at <a href="https://github.com/khamper">https://github.com/khamper.</a></h2>
    <h2>ok bye everybody</h2>

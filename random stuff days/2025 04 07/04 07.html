    <h2>alright, since i have many assignments this week (1 down, 3 to go), i'll try to record a video this weekend (something related to gaming) and try to edit it until next week</h2>
    <h2>about the easter holidays, i will be busy during easter sunday and monday, but by tuesday, i'll be sure to make more videos during that time</h2>
    <h2>also, my birthday is coming up (May 2nd), so i'll try to also make a video on that</h2>
    <h2>after this assigment mania week, there won't be that many assigments after, so hopefully i'll be more active.</h2>
    <h3>also, i created a throne page for people to contribute to my purchases (<a href="https://throne.com/popsicl">https://throne.com/popsicl</a>), i don't expect anyone contributing to these purchases, but if you decide to do, just throw in 50 cents (idk)</h3>
    <h2>anyways, i'm gonna go study reported speech, because i'm writing about that tomorrow</h2>

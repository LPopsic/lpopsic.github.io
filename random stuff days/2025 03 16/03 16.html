        <h2>day 1 (monday): i didn't go to school that day, then like 3 hours later i had a heating pad on to numb my neck pain. then during the day i just did nothing, was just thinking "should i go to school with this neck pain and skip pe, or not go to school and wait until the neck pain goes away?"</h2>

    <div style="margin: 50px 0 50px;">
        <h2>day 2 (tuesday (independence day of lithuania)): 6:27am. my head started to hurt and i couldn't sleep. 30-40 minutes later: literally cannot sleep and had to wake up at 7am. i don't remember the temperature, but it was somewhere around 37.4째-37.7째. the neck pain is healed a bit better, but not fully. i was just at bed all day, didn't really have the energy to eat something, drank a lot of tea aswell.</h2>

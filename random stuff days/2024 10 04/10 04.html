    <h1>hello everyone</h1>
    <h2>after a month (for the 2nd time)</h2>
    <h2>i was supposed to write this at the end of september but then i forgot so here we go</h2>
    <h3>so, things have been going a bit good for me. i had some conflicts with my friends, but the situation right now is a little bit better.</h3>
    <h3>as for school, september was the perfect month for me, because there were less assignments. october will be a pain in the butt because i have 6-8 assignments that month. after these assignments, holidays!</h3>
    <h3>i do plan releasing 2-3 videos this month, including one video, which will be released either tomorrow or on sunday.</h3>
    <h3>as for my tests (aka NMPP (National tests of student achievement)), i will be writing them in february 2025, so there's a very unlikely chance that a video would be released.</h3>
    <h2>alright i think that's enough for me to say</h2>
    <h2>if i feel like it i might add more</h2>
    <h1>goodbye</h1>

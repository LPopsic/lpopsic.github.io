    <h2>MY NECK F**KING HURTS</h2>
    <h2>backstory: on saturday, i was playing basketball with my dad (i also shot from the middle court) and then i went to sleep</h2>
    <h2>then, the next day (sunday) when i went outside with my friend, my neck started to ache for a bit</h2>
    <h2>about an hour later, it happened. so, i rushed home and for some reason, i can't turn my head left otherwise my neck will hurt really badly</h2>
    <h2>then, i went home and finally the next day (monday) i didn't have to go to school today :))</h2>
    <h2>so, i'm feeling a lot better now, best possible case is that i'm going to go to school on wednesday, even though i have a public speaking assignment and a book assignment :(</h2>
    <h2>worst possible case, i'm not going to go to school this week and suffer with this neck strain :(((</h2>
    <h3>also, i removed the carshalton thing because i decided this should stay private, but not on the public in case someone finds it out, and i don't want that to happen</h3>

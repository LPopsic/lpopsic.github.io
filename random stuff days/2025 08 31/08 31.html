    <h1>hello peoples</h1>
    <h2>i'm going to explain this in short, but basically, school is going to start again tomorrow. (a new longer post will be uploaded today on my yt channel)</h2>
    <h2>i already have planned the rest of the year with some videos, so look out for that</h2>
    <h2>that being said, during this time, i will be editing less and less due to school stuff, and there will be another thing this school year that forces me to go to the other side of the country (i'll be talking about this sometime)</h2>
    <h2>so yeah, i have planned everything that i need, but dont get your hopes too high</h2>
    <h2>anyways, new post coming out this evening about this but in more detail</h2>
    <h2>i'll see you later, hopefully sometime.</h2>

    <h1>hi everyone!</h1>
    <h3>tldr: yes</h3>
    <h2>alright, i'm finally back after 1 & 1/2 months of inactivity</h2>
    <h2>i was mostly busy with life, just playing games with my friends, going outside more and some other stuff</h2>
    <h2>after the germany trip (which ended well thank god) i didn't really have motivation of editing this website and finishing the "renovation" of some websites (i don't know if i'm going to finish them this summer)</h2>
    <h2>so i just ignored this file for like a solid month</h2>
    <h2>i don't really think i'm gonna make more videos this august, because:</h2>
    <h2>1. i don't really have anymore ideas to make. while yes, i have some projects on hold, (mainly because of me not finishing them) i just don't have the courage to finish them. besides, i don't really do much on the computer nowadays, so i just go outside with my friends and that's it.</h2>
    <h2>2. lack of motivation. like i said in the first point, i don't have the courage to make videos, or, i think of an idea, then it evaporates after like a day or something like that. yes, i know that there's like 14 days left until school starts (which will be the worst school year of my life) and i need to edit a video or something like that. but come on, i made 4 youtube shorts, 5 youtube videos and 6 different songs on fl studio (i'm a music producer now hello my men) this summer. i think it's time for me to take a rest and enjoy what's left of this stupid summer holiday</h2>
    <h2>BUT, expect videos, youtube shorts (yes, including more episodes of "candy review") and new songs starting from september, and maybe expect a new popsicl podcast episode sometime this year.</h2>
    <h2>as for programming, i will try to program in python this september instead of c++, (c++ was a nightmare for me from september 2023 - june 2024) i hope it will be actually easy to program in python (also, Random-random-new-Random- will not be updated to c++, i'm just gonna leave it as it is)</h2>
    <h2>alright everybody, i'm heading off</h2>
    <h2>see you all sometime</h2>
